# Hey ! I'm Clem, Nice to meet you

I am an Android Dev with many years of working experience including :
- Project Management 📔
- Logistics Management 📦
- Business development 🎯

Right now, I am working with Kotlin, Flow, Coroutines, MVVM and Clean Architecture.

I love understanding things to the core so please teach me!

I also love team based competitive video games, I like to think we're on the same boat heading towards the same direction, so let's collaborate 😁
